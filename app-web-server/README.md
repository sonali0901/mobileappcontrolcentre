Malaria App Project [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nerdylicious/app-web-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nerdylicious/app-web-server)
==============

The malaria-app-readme repository is intended to be the central repo for discussions, decision making, and feedback about the project goals and features so that the user experience across platforms is uniform. Comments and coding for a specific platform can happen at the repositories linked to below.

<h3>Link to README Repo:</h3> https://github.com/PeaceCorps/malaria-app-readme


Please keep all discussion regarding features that will be cross-platform on that repository, and code-specific discussion on this one.




<h2>Application Description</h2>

Peace Corps is looking to build a mobile app that will aid the Volunteer in sustaining life-saving malaria prevention tactics over their 2+ years of service. Prevention is focused on sustained use of preventive medications, which are taken either daily or weekly, depending on the medicine. The application will feature a reminder system; an ability to indicate that medication was taken on time or missed; the ability for the volunteer to track their usage history; a trip indicator to help remind volunteers to pack certain supplies to prevent malaria if they leave their home village; and an Info Hub that will provide accurate information about Malaria and the medications they are taking. 

Included in this repository are Adobe Illustrator (.ai), and Adobe PDF (.pdf) files that were created by University of Michigan design students to meet the requirements listed above. These resources are intended to be the building blocks of iOS and Android applications.

Also included in this repository for reference and background are two recent studies conducted by the CDC pertaining to use of preventative tactics by volunteers and their reasons for compliance or non-compliance with taking their medicine.
